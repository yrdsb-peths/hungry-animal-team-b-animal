The concept of abstract classes can be seen in the classes 'Food', 'Apple' and 'Strawberry'. 'Food' is the abstract class, 'Apple' and 'Strawberry' are the subclasses under 'Food'.

Polymorphism can be seen in the class 'MyWorld' under the method 'createFood()'. Polymorphism means having many forms, it can be seen that 'food' can either "take form" of a 'new Apple()' or a 'new Strawberry()'.

Overriding is used in the classes 'Food', 'Apple' and 'Strawberry'. All three classes include a method called 'move()', the difference is that the method in 'Food' is empty but in the classes 'Apple' and 'Strawberry' the methods are defined. This will override the empty 'move()' method in the class 'Food'.
